# ProgrammableVents mod for RimWorld


Adds programmable and flickable vents! 
Better control over temperatures with vents! Using this mod, you'll be able to use the ambient temperature efficiently and save energy. 



Programmable vents lets you target a temperature and will only let air flow when useful.
The logic is quite simple; the air will only flow in these configurations: 
- Room 1 T° < Target T° < Room 2 T° 
- Room 1 T° > Target T° > Room 2 T° 

Meaning it will let the air flow only when it would help a room reach the target temperature. 

Programmable vents consume 20w and cost 50 steel & 1 component.


Compatible with existing games, should not cause any compatibility issues!
